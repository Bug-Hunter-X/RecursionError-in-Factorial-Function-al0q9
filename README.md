# RecursionError in Factorial Function
This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The `factorial` function, while conceptually correct, fails for larger inputs due to excessive recursive calls.  The solution provides an iterative approach to avoid this limitation.
